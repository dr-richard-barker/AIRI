# Stage I: Space Invaders Data Literacy

## Welcome to the AIRI Data Literacy Space Invaders League

**Please visit our website**, create and name your own Avatar, and then play Space Invaders! Your game data will be harvested and incorporated into your very own data journey, allowing you to learn about tables, bar charts, scatter plots, and all the data tools we use to understand plants. By engaging in this, you will gain a better understanding of data created by both a team and in competition with your friends, notably in your mission to save Earth from the Space Invaders.

### Creating Your Avatar

All participants are asked to use fictional names for their avatars and imagine how their character represents their gameplay intentions. This is a crucial part of understanding the importance and changes involved in sharing data online, both in the context of research data from the program and regarding your personal online avatar.

### Importance of Data Literacy

For students, understanding data literacy is essential. This program not only focuses on the educational aspects but also emphasizes the importance of data privacy and ethical data sharing. The knowledge gained here can have a lasting impact on their academic and personal lives, making them more conscious and responsible digital citizens.

### Highlighting Interesting Characters

In our AIRI data literacy Space Invaders league, we’d like to highlight some interesting characters and the names of their avatars. For example, "Shark" was a participant who only played twice but exhibited such focus that they achieved the highest score and the longest average game time. Another notable player is known as "The Spacer." Such individual stories demonstrate the diverse strategies and skills among participants.

### Our Partners: KidsinData

The AIRI data literacy program proudly partners with KidsinData to bring an unparalleled educational experience. This collaboration ensures that participants not only enjoy the gaming aspect but also significantly benefit from the educational tools and insights provided. Together, we aim to cultivate an enriched learning environment where data literacy is made accessible and engaging for all.
