### AstroBotany Educational Ethos, tools and techniques <a href="#mr1nbxnfln3u" id="mr1nbxnfln3u"></a>

The goal of the AIRI program is to create a collaborative international environment in which students, educators, researchers, and citizen scientists are able to contribute to astrobotany research in future space missions. We aim to share methods and data openly to help students and researchers around the world learn from each other's experiences while using the AIRI project-based learning program. It doesn’t matter if you are a professor lecturing in higher education or an informal citizen scientist with a passion for plants or space. We believe in equity in education, so we’ve added tables showing how AIRI can help teachers create authentic project-based research experiences that achieve next-generation science standards.

The AIRI program aims to be holistic and inclusive of all people. We are brand agnostic but will recommend specific tools that have enabled successful experiments previously. For example, [Epicollect5](https://five.epicollect.net/) is a citizen science data harvesting tool where people around the world share data. There are other data-sharing mechanisms. However, this one has an open-source data application programming interface (API) that makes it quicker and easier to share data.

Our goal is to empower citizen scientists to develop novel urban agricultural innovations as part of a new greener revolution on this planet and others. Equity lies at the roots of education.

**Figure 1:** Education is often considered to be a pyramid scheme, but with an open framework and the embracement of the role of the arts in science communication we can build a more inclusive research community.

### &#x20;"Kids in data" space invader game is a fun step towards data literacy <a href="#msamk3lsrt9k" id="msamk3lsrt9k"></a>

Participants are encouraged to discuss online data sharing and the creation of online avatars. Researchers need to be aware of their digital footprints and the associated risks and opportunities. These concepts are approached through partaking in a space invaders computer game league where the results from previous participants can be viewed using interactive relational databases provided by Qlik and the KidsInData literacy program.

### " What's your favorite microgreen" <a href="#aiwkhr4etifn" id="aiwkhr4etifn"></a>

Help us work out what the world's favourite microgreen is. Do you use data to inform your decision? Everyone is different so let's see what the collective answer is and why? Does your choice relate to your age, location, or something else? To help share your Insights with the AstroBotany Research Community please Participate in our platform to share your thoughts on microgreens with the AstroBotany research community. Your input is crucial! The Key Questions we aim to answer is related to your preference, does it depend on age, location, or other factors? Do you rely on data to make your choice or it just your taste buds or gut that make the decision? Help us use nutritional and yield data while we discover the world's most popular microgreen we also create [USDA microgreen meta-data application](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fastrobiology.botany.wisc.edu%2Feducation-outreach%2Fmicrogreendiversity\&sa=D\&sntz=1\&usg=AOvVaw2e4sc\_CKnrmUUEjB9puXDC) to help provide you with experimental data while you select your favorite microgreen variety.

### Program Stage III Summary: **Growth of Microgreens in Terrestrial Environments** <a href="#d33iimqtnpj5" id="d33iimqtnpj5"></a>

In this stage, participants will grow microgreens in the soil in order to collect quantitative and qualitative data on growth patterns. Participants may choose to extend this investigation by comparing selected crops grown hydroponically using a Hamama kit or their own DIY protocol. There are multiple variations possible, such as growth in varied nutrient media as well variants in light quality or quantity. It is important to isolate 1 or 2 factors of choice for analysis and record your methods in your Science Journal to ensure they are reproducible. We recommend using your smartphone to save the primary data, such as photos or numbers using this [EpiCollect5 AIRI MicroGreen Easy Leaf Area](https://five.epicollect.net/project/airi-microgreen-easy-leaf-area) project to help you organize your data collection so it can be shared with other researchers. The introduction to the image analysis component requires the researcher to have access to a digital camera or smart device. There are many software tools that analyze images available on laptops or desktop computers. First, we’ll introduce the _Easy Leaf Area_ software, which can be accessed on Android phones, or PC’s running Windows, iOS or Linux. Visit the software [github](https://github.com/heaslon/Easy-Leaf-Area) page to download.

### **Microgreen Development and Gravitropic Response** <a href="#f1idriw9fonq" id="f1idriw9fonq"></a>

Software options for this project can help you collect important meta-data, and primary imaging data, and optimize your experimental parameters to ensure your data is comparable and shareable with the research community. Quantitative data will be collected through root mapping using Fiji, SmartRoot, and AstroDart, along with Urban microgreen EpiCollect5.

This stage will focus on growing microgreens on plant-based agar or wet filter paper to observe and measure root growth kinetics. After recording initial root growth at three-time points (e.g., days 3, 4, and 5 post-germination), the gravity vector will be rotated 90 degrees to observe root adaptation to this stimulus.

### **Turning microgreens into stem cell cultures & taking cuttings / making plant clones** <a href="#e63implf3dp0" id="e63implf3dp0"></a>

One of the greatest tools a researcher has is the strength to ask a well-structured question, “[Research gate](https://www.researchgate.net/)” is an excellent social media platform for this. This is real research so remember to write down your thoughts, and record the volumes you use and the material you need for your experiments. We recommend using the text document or spreadsheet “Science Journal” as a digital notebook as it allows you to quickly link note and sensor measurements to photos and time stamps. Some laboratory protocols start to get more advanced such as investigations into genes and genomes then the ability to save, store and visualize DNA sequence becomes essential. We recommend the [Benchling software](https://www.benchling.com/) as it provides these slightly more advanced molecular biology features and it's nice to keep all protocols in one place. This is an example protocol from a scientist that turns Arabidopsis seedlings into stem cell cultures. Germinate your seeds on a medium that contains the right concentration of Auxin (2,4-D). Paul _et al_ (2002) created a callus induction media using the following recipe (Sterile conditions are essential for this to work). You can adapt this protocol for microgreen species.

### **Modeling auxin transport and movement** <a href="#e63implf3dp0" id="e63implf3dp0"></a>

Understanding how auxin affects plants at a cellular level is difficult and requires computers to model and make simulations. These computer programs are designed to use mathematical models to describe the physical and mechanical characteristics of how cells function. These models can be used to investigate how chemicals might move across membranes to form concentration gradients. This movement is often coordinated by special proteins that sit in cell membranes and are responsible for transporting important signalling hormones. Some transporters are influenced by environmental factors such as light and gravity. The SimuPlant modelling software allows you to explore this fundamental biology at a cellular and molecular scale. Read a [summary of the model here](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/content/model-of-the-month?year=2013\&month=01) and down the [SimuPlant](https://www.simuplant.org/) modelling software.

### **Phototropic Response of Microgreens Grown in Simulated Microgravity** <a href="#q5yflw39kqlv" id="q5yflw39kqlv"></a>

* The most advanced stage of AIRI focuses on the effects that simulated microgravity has on the development of microgreens. This will be achieved through the utilization of the CoSE Gravity Chamber (or any DIY 2D slow-rotating vessels you may have).
* More information on 3D clinostats found at CoSEcloud.com
* More information on how to build your own DIY 2D clinostat found at[ Dr Andrea Henles SpaceBiology website](https://spacebiology.carthage.edu/grade-6-12-educators).
* Qualitative and quantitative data will be collected and analyzed through the utilization of _Easy Leaf_ , _RootNav 2.0 , SmartRoot and AstroDart_ software.
