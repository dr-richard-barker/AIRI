### **Introduction to data sharing with SpaceInvaders (Kids in Data)** <a href="#p6zi7ahz56i2" id="p6zi7ahz56i2"></a>

The AIRI data literacy program proudly partners with KidsinData to bring an educational[ SpaceInvaders Gaming data experience](https://astrobiology.botany.wisc.edu/education-outreach/kidsindata-science-edtec). Please visit our website, create and name your own Avatar, and then play SpaceInvaders! These data are harvested and incorporated into your very own data journey. Learn about tables, bar charts, scatter plots, and all the data tools we use to understand plants. This will help you understand the data created by a team or in competition with your friends, such as in pursuit of saving Earth from SpaceInvaders.

**Figure 2:** The data is presented on a “dashboard.” These graphical user interfaces allow citizens and researchers to access data. This one shows how many people have played the game, total scores, game duration and a range of other meta-data.

### **Edible microgreens on Earth and Low Earth Orbit (LEO)** <a href="#id-1vv57eymsn9r" id="id-1vv57eymsn9r"></a>

Future space missions, as well as extended human space habitation, are critically dependent on sustainably and effectively maintaining both the physiological and psychological health of crew members in space. One important factor paramount to mission success is the capability of providing optimal nutritional conditions for crew members while reducing the need for Earth-based resupply. Food packaging, storage, and restocking currently pose significant challenges to extended human presence in space. (To introduce students to Martian exploration, we recommend the “[Kids2Space](https://kids2.space/encyclopedia/)” video program ).

The cultivation of edible produce through the integration of plant-based bioregenerative life support systems provides viable solutions to challenges associated with crew health as well as minimizing the costs associated with resupplying. Growing plants throughout space missions has demonstrated its potential to become a source of fresh produce for space crews, while also contributing to gas and water recycling. In addition, the cultivation of plants on the ISS has shown to mitigate psychological stresses and depression associated with long-duration space habitation.

### **The ideal crop or “Ideotype” for the spacefligt environment?**  <a href="#id-2tffh2t4zta7" id="id-2tffh2t4zta7"></a>

Ideal plants to be grown in space are selected based on the following criteria: crop potential (yield, edible biomass as well as oxygen and water production); ratio of total biomass to edible biomass (harvest index); crop growth efficiency (growth time and space required, nutrient value; and crop horticultural needs (development, energy requirements, water utilization, harvesting, and crop processing). In summary, plants grown in space should require minimal crew attention and preparation time, while producing nutrient dense-yields. Additionally, these plants need to have fast growth cycles while requiring minimal growth space and water intake. ![](.gitbook/assets/8.png)

An ideal crop type that fits this criteria are salad crops. Salad crops are suitable for modular chamber cultivation due to their minimal space requirements. The majority of salad crops have relatively short growth cycles and require minimal horticultural care. In addition, most salad crops can be eaten fresh. This program focuses on the effects of a specific salad speciality crop in microgravity: microgreens.

Microgreens are small (2.5cm-8cm in height), colorful, nutrient-dense crops that are often used to enhance flavor in dishes. Generated from vegetables, legumes, grasses and herb seeds, microgreens typically have short species-specific production cycles lasting between one to three weeks. They are harvested after their cotyledons are expanded and the first set of true leaves have emerged. Studies from the USDA have shown that at equal weights, most microgreens contain about 5-30 times more nutrients than what is found in the mature leaves of the same plants. Due to their high nutrient concentrations, fast growth cycles, minimal water/space, and horticultural requirements, microgreens could be considered as an integral component of a bioregenerative life support system. This enables them to contribute to both the dietary and psychological needs of space crews.

_Arabidopsis thaliana_ is a model plant that has been used to investigate how plant morphology changes in response to their environment as they age. Their genomes express themselves during the different developmental stages they go through. Understanding how Arabidopsis responds to environmental changes gives us the opportunity to potentially engineer improved crops with architecture that moe closely responsemble the "Ideotype".  Practicing[ time-lapse photography ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxPuEViG-6g\&ab\_channel=RichardBarker)is a good way to learn how fast different species grow.

### **The cell biology of “gravitropism”** <a href="#xoaefro89a34" id="xoaefro89a34"></a>

Gravity plays a key role in plant development. Stems grow toward a light source and roots toward a gravity vector. In the absence of light, stems grow in the opposite direction of the gravity vector. These directional growth responses to external stimuli are known as **tropisms**. Growth in the direction of light is called **phototropism**. **Gravitropism** is the growth response related to gravitational force.

**Figures 4:** (A) Auxin flows in a “reverse fountain” in the root tip. (B) A gravitropic stimuli (90 degree rotation) causes the auxin to accumulate on the new bottom of the root. (C) Asymmetric distribution of the plant hormone auxin causes organs to bend (Source: Strohm et al., (2012) Molecular mechanisms of root gravity sensing and signal transduction. DOI:[10.1002/wdev.14](https://doi.org/10.1002/wdev.14)).

Plants use hormones, affected by light and gravity, to regulate the growth of stems and roots. The hormone **auxin** is integral to both gravitropism and phototropism. The upward growth of stems and downward growth of roots is affected by gravity. Root tips have specialized cells that contain bead-like organelles called **statoliths**. When a root is repositioned on its side, the statoliths accumulate on the lower side of the cells. The accumulation of statoliths triggers feedback mechanisms in the plant that direct auxin to the site where the statoliths are. High concentrations of auxin in root cells inhibit cell elongation. This causes the bottom cells to stop elongating while the top cells continue at a consistent rate, resulting in the root bend and redirecting itself according to the center of gravity.

### **The major challenges for plant development in microgravity** <a href="#o1hmthfexs0v" id="o1hmthfexs0v"></a>

_**We often get asked: How does gravity affect plant development and growth in space?**_

Microgravity affects root growth patterns as well as various elements in plant biology. Not only does gravity affect how roots and stems grow, but it also affects essential biological processes impacting how the plant develops. One of the processes affected is plant gas exchange and mixing. Convection cells, where warmer air rises and cooler air falls, do not occur in microgravity environments. This reduces the amount of air circulation that occurs, which can cause gas accumulation in cells. As plants give off CO2, it stays close to the plant, displacing O2 and causing hypoxic zones in the plant. This can restrict O2 supply which causes local hypoxic zones near the surface of the plant. Development in areas of plants that have high metabolic and respiring rates, such as root tips, are then at risk of being affected. This could potentially negatively impact crop yields and the nutritional density of plants grown in microgravity.

**Figure 5:** How plants respond to microgravity is hard to generalize. It depends on the variety since different growth patterns have evolved and been selected for during crop breeding. Plants size and shapes are determined by environmental signals that are perceived and translated into specific developmental responses.
