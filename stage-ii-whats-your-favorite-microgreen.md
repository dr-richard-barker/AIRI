# Stage II:  What's your favorite microgreen?

### Stage II Summary: " What's your favorite microgreen" <a href="#aiwkhr4etifn" id="aiwkhr4etifn"></a>

As a Space Biology scientist who is interested in the study of microgreens, requesting your collaboration. We are on a mission to find the world's favorite microgreen. This project aims to understand the factors that influence these preferences.

We have developed a USDA microgreen meta-data application ([USDA microgreen meta-data application](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fastrobiology.botany.wisc.edu%2Feducation-outreach%2Fmicrogreendiversity\&sa=D\&sntz=1\&usg=AOvVaw2e4sc\_CKnrmUUEjB9puXDC)) that provides experimental data on various microgreen varieties. This data, which includes nutritional and yield information, can be a valuable tool in making informed decisions.

However, we understand that the choice of a favorite microgreen is not always data-driven. Factors such as age, location, taste preference, and even gut feeling can play a significant role. Thatâ€™s why your input is so crucial.

By participating in our platform and sharing your thoughts, you will be contributing to a broader understanding of microgreen preferences. Your insights will not only enrich our research but also provide valuable data that can influence future studies in AstroBotany.

So, I invite you to join us in this scientific exploration. Share your thoughts, let your preferences be heard, and contribute to the AstroBotany Research Community. Your collaboration can help us answer key questions and shed light on the fascinating world of microgreens. Thank you for considering this invitation. We look forward to your valuable contribution.&#x20;
