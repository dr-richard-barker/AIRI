As a Space Biology scientist who is interested in the study of microgreens, requesting your collaboration. We are on a mission to find the world's favourite microgreen. This project aims to understand the factors that influence these preferences. Have you ever wondered what it takes to grow delicious, nutritious food in space? We're on a mission to find out through AstroBotany, the science of cultivating plants on spaceships!

By sharing your favourite microgreen and why it tickles your taste buds, you'll be contributing to groundbreaking research. Your unique perspective matters â€“ age, location, and even a gut feeling can be valuable insights!
