# Hydropatterning model

## Hydropatterning model

Ever wonder how growth and the environment locally affect the water potential of tissues and the patterning of lateral roots?  Neil Robbins did and wrote this interactive [Shiny app](https://nrobbins.shinyapps.io/20161105\_hydropatterning\_app/) that lets you explore a computational model of hydropatterning with the ease of a user friendly GUI.  Work described in a recent manuscript submitted to BioRxiv (Robbins II and Dinneny, 2017).  Enjoy!
