The AIRI data literacy program proudly partners with KidsinData to bring an educational[ SpaceInvaders Gaming data experience](https://astrobiology.botany.wisc.edu/education-outreach/kidsindata-science-edtec). Please visit our website, create and name your own Avatar, and then play SpaceInvaders! These data are harvested and incorporated into your very own data journey. Learn about tables, bar charts, scatter plots, and all the data tools we use to understand plants. This will help you understand the data created by a team or in competition with your friends, such as in pursuit of saving Earth from SpaceInvaders.

**Figure 2:** The data is presented on a “dashboard.” These graphical user interfaces allow citizens and researchers to access data. This one shows how many people have played the game, total scores, game duration and a range of other meta-data.
