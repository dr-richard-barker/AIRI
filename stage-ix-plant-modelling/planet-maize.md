# PlaNet-maize

#### About the app

The focus of PlaNet-Maize is to investigate the effect of environmental and endogenous factors on the growth and water relations of the maize plant. This functional–structural plant model (FSPM) encompasses the entire soil-plant-atmosphere continuum with a sub-organ resolution. The model simulates the growth and development of an individual maize plant and the flux of water through the plant structure, from the rhizosphere to the leaf boundary layer.This web interface only display basic capabilities of PlaNet-Maize, mainly for teaching purposes.
