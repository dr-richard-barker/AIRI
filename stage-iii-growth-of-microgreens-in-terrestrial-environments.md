# Stage III: Growth of Microgreens in Terrestrial Environments

In this stage, participants focus on growth patterns of microgreens in soil growth media. Key data collections centre around growth rates, leaf cover density, and edible biomass. Future space missions will require crews to have access to fresh nutrient-dense crops that are able to be grown quickly, easily, and in limited space. This inquiry seeks to highlight microgreen crops that may be utilized in future space mission studies.

**Length of Stage: \~14 Days**

**Supplies:**

### **STAGE III Protocol Leaf Analysis** <a href="#dk0cvmxse3pz" id="dk0cvmxse3pz"></a>

* **Preparations to be conducted prior to starting:** Download and install Easy Leaf Area and Easy Leaf Canopy Free on android devices. Alternatively plants can be imaged with cameras and then the images transferred to a PC or Mac OS for subsequent analysis.

(See Getting Started on Easy Leaf Area section for details).

* Print red color scales (These files are included in the Easy Leaf Program file) this makes its easier to measure your greens (alternatively you can add the red square manually later but this can introduce error if the scale is wrong).
* Gather trays depending on the amount of growing groups (Ex: Four groups, two trays each), check they don’t leak.
* Check light intensity, temperature and any timers or time-lapse photography devices you plan to use.

**Figure 11:** In this example the microgreen tray has been placed on the button rack under white LED’s. This enabled the researcher to place the camera in front and above to perform time lapse photography.

### **STAGE III: Microgreen Planting Protocol**

* Use the [Hamama kit](https://www.hamama.com/) instructions, or
  * If not using the kit, please precisely record any variations in your protocol using your “Science Journal”.
  * Fill a single tray with dry soil and weigh (Record the weight of this tray and use it as a reference for subsequent trays).
  * Pick out dry seeds to be used (At least two different seed types).
  * Weigh appropriate amount of seeds for the selected tray size.
  * Utilize[ the microgreen density calculator t](https://jscalc.io/calc/vqHxgaGIt3RncroW)o measure ideal seed quantities:
* Have participant groups spread their soil evenly in each observational planting tray.
* Add water to growing trays. (Soil should be damp, but not flooded)
* Evenly spread selected seeds throughout specified trays per seed type. (Seeds can also be spread in rows within the trays. If multiple seeds will be represented in single trays, it is important that each row is properly labelled.)
* Gently scattering on the surface of the soil (or growth media). Seeds shouldn’t be covered by soil so don’t plant them deeply. Ideally just a light dusting of soil over the top, put some of the dry soil in a flour sifting sieve and tap the side to get a light dust of soil over the seeds.
* Mist planted seeds with water.
* Make sure to label each tray with the seed type, date planted, and elevation.
* Place near a light source (Windows, or LED lights. Specify light source in datasheet).
* Mist soil daily in order to keep it damp.
* Measure the light intensity above your plant canopy. An easy way to do this is download the “Google Science Journal Application ''. This tool allows you to use your smart device's camera to measure the light intensity. Try to get the device right in the center of the tray. You can even create a map to show the light distribution over your entire canopy.

**General Observations Protocols:**

* The provided general observations template document has sections to record the following measurements:
  * Ambient temperature at the time of recording
  * Elevation
  * Date and Time of observations
* In the provided template observations document, participants should record observations regarding regarding all data points collected as well as qualitative records regarding the following points:
  * Rate of growth

* Do this on the 4th, 8th, and 12th day after planting

**Edible Biomass Measurement Protocol**

* After all observations have been collected on the 12th day after planting, edible biomass measurements are to be recorded in the general observations document for each tray separately.
* Harvest microgreen by removing them from soil media then cutting them at the base of the plant (the point before the roots grow out from)

  * Follow the EasyLeafArea Protocol to analyze images

### **Easy Leaf Area Protocol**

**WHAT IS EASY LEAF AREA**

Easy leaf area is free, open source, software that rapidly measures leaf area in digital images (photographs or scanner images). Easy leaf area uses the RGB value of each pixel to identify leaf and scale regions in each image

**GETTING STARTED:**

* This program analyzes single jpeg or tiff images or batches of images for leaf area.
* Images must have a red scale of known area in the image in the same plane as the leaves for the program to use as a reference scale (This can be added in photoshop or other “Paint” software packages).
* Download and install Easy Leaf Area on a designated computer or [**Android** ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.heaslon.EasyLeafArea)device application.
  * This software runs on android as an app, or can be used with images moved to a PC, linux or MacOS.
  * [https://github.com/heaslon/Easy-Leaf-Area](https://github.com/heaslon/Easy-Leaf-Area)
* Follow the instruction on their website: [https://github.com/heaslon/Easy-Leaf-Area](https://github.com/heaslon/Easy-Leaf-Area)
