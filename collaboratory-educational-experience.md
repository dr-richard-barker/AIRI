# Collaboratory Educational Experience

More work is needed to fix / finish / delete page.





Below is a range of educational and research tools, videos, and animations putting them in an AstroBiology context.&#x20;

This educational program is still under development and we welcome collaborators.&#x20;

Answer [this AstroBotany questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfSxxfrPosKyUo\_j-zdnNM-yVnpUNOUA3NA-7aWBEJGYnvfOQ/viewform) and become a member of our distributed research team!

It contains various educational and research-related questions that will help you develop the critical skills required to become an AstroBiologist.

Feel free to test these materials with your class. If the link below does work then please [use this pop out option](https://gilroy-qlik.botany.wisc.edu/a/sense/app/94b382d7-a34e-4697-b966-ff593114b62b/overview) that will launch into a new tab in your browser.&#x20;



Why isn't this link working any more?

## Biological questions considered by astrobotanists <a href="#h.skbz5rn6pwkv_l" id="h.skbz5rn6pwkv_l"></a>

* How do you imagine the environment influences biology at the molecular level?
* How do you imagine gene expression changes might affect cellular function?&#x20;
* How might cells communicate with each other over long distances?
* How might tissues and organs be affected by changes in gravity or increase radiation?
* Explore this (or any other) 3D model of a cell, find your favourite organelle (Mitochondria, plastids, ER,  etc. ) and take a photo(s) of it.
* Use the button below to launch [ImageJ](https://ij.imjoy.io/) and then try to measure the size of your organelle.
