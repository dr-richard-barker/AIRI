# STAGE VII: Computational modeling of plant hormone transport.

### Root Tissue and Gravity Perception

### Introduction

Root tissues are vital components of a plant, responsible for numerous functions including anchorage, absorption of water and nutrients, and storage of food. Understanding the structure and function of root tissues is fundamental to grasping how plants interact with their environment, particularly in response to gravity, a phenomenon known as gravitropism.

### Anatomy of Root Tissue

It is important to understand the anatomy of Root tissues and how they are organized into several layers, each with distinct roles:

1. **Epidermis**
   * The outermost layer providing protection.
   * Absorbs water and nutrients from the soil.
2. **Cortex**
   * Located just beneath the epidermis.
   * Facilitates storage and transport of nutrients and water.
3. **Endodermis**
   * Acts as a selective barrier controlling the flow of substances into the vascular system.
4. **Pericycle**
   * Initiates the growth of lateral roots.
5. **Vascular Tissue (Xylem and Phloem)**
   * Xylem transports water and dissolved minerals from roots to shoots.
   * Phloem distributes sugars and organic nutrients from shoots to roots.

### Gravity Perception in Roots

#### Gravitropism: Gravitropism, the growth response of plants to gravity, is critical for proper root development. Roots grow downward (positive gravitropism) to anchor the plant and access deeper water sources.

#### Mechanism of Gravity Perception

* **Amyloplasts**: Specialized plastids in root cap cells that act as gravity sensors.
  * Contain dense starch grains that settle within the cell under the influence of gravity.
  * Their movement triggers a signaling pathway modifying the distribution of growth hormones like auxins.
* **Auxins**: Hormones regulating cell elongation.
  * Redistribution of auxins to the lower side of the root inhibits cell elongation on that side.
  * This causes the root to bend downward, orienting its growth in the direction of gravity.

**Summary and Application Discussion**

**Follow Up Inquiry:**

* Based on the observations made during this study, what conclusions can be made about the movement of auxin in root tips of plants?
* Do you think this will influence roots growth?
  * Justify your previous answer?
* How would this change in the environment such as the absence of gravity effect auxin distribution in the root?

**Expansion:**

* Based on these observations, what directions do plants grow towards? (stems, leaves)
* How can this idea be tested?
